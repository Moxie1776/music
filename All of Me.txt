All of Me

Verse 1
(Am, F, C, G)
[Am]What would I [F]do without your smart m[C]outh
Drawing me i[G]n, and kicking me out[Am]
Got my hea[F]d spinning, n[C]o kidding, I ca[G]nt pin you down[Am]
Whats going o[F]n in that beautiful mi[C]nd
Im on your magi[G]cal mystery rid[Am]e
And Im s[F]o dizzy, dont k[C]now what hit me, but I[G]ll be alri[Am]ght

Chorus (C, Am, F, G)
Cause a[C]ll of me
Loves a[Am]ll of you
Love your cu[F]rves and all your edges
All your pe[G]rfect imperfections
Give your a[C]ll to me
Ill give my [Am]all to you
Youre my [F]end and my beginning
Even w[G]hen I lose Im winning
Cause I give you a[Am]ll, a[F]ll of m[C]e[G]
And you give me a[Am]ll, al[F]l of yo[C]u, o[G]h

Even when youre cr[G]ying you?re beautiful [Am]too
The world is b[F]eating you [C]down, Im [G]around through eve[Am]ry move
Youre my dow[F]nfall, youre my [C]muse
My worst dist[G]raction, my rhythm and bl[Am]ues
I cant stop sin[F]ging, its rin[C]ging, in[G] my head for[Am] you
