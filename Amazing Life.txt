Amazing Life
Britt Nicole

It's a [Am]b, b, beautiful [Em]world we've been given
[Am]From the top of the [Em]sky to the ocean
[Am]I'll never under-[Dm]stand it all
[Am]It must be super-[Dm]natural

It's a [Am]m, m, magical [Em]thing a starry night
[Am]Feel, feel so [Em]small under a billion lights
[Am]Never under-[Dm]stand it all
[Am]It must be super-[Dm]natural

Amazing [Am]li-[F]i-[C]ife
Amazing [Am]li-[F]i-[C]ife

Flying [Am]higher than [F]I've ever [C]dreamed
From the [Am]top of the [F]world I could [C]scream

Amazing [Am]li-[F]i-[C]ife
Amazing [Am]li-[F]i-[C]ife
It's a [Am]colorful, colorful [Em]world painted so bright
[Am]Gonna walk on [Em]air, gonna take flight
[Am]Never under-[Dm]stand it all
[Am]It must be super-[Dm]natural

I wanna [Am]drink, drink, drink every [Em]drop of sunshine

[Am]Gotta smile on my [Em]face, I won't apologize
[Am]I'll never under-[Dm]stand it all
[Am]It must be super-[Dm]natural

You're the [Am]burning in my [F]heart that never [Am]dies, never [F]dies
Without You [Am]here my [F]world is black and [Am]white, black and [F]white
Like a [Am]show without a [F]stage
Like a [Am]storm without the [F]rain
You're the [Am]one I can't [F]replace
Need You be my [Am]side, Need You be my [F]side
