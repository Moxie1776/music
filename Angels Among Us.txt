Angels Among Us
by Alabama

Verse
[G]I was walkin' home from school on a [Em]cold winter [C]day
[G]Took a short [Em]cut through the [C]woods and I lost my [D7]way
[G]It was gettin' [D7]late and I was [Em]scared and [C]alone
Then a [G]kind old man [Em]took my hand and [C]led me [D7]home
[C]Momma couldn't [G]see him but [C]he was standin' [D7]there
And I [C]knew in my [G]heart he was the [C]answer to my [D7]prayer

Chorus
Oh [G]I be[Em]lieve there are [C]angels [D7]among us
[G]Sent down to [Em]us from [C]somewhere up [D7]above
They come to [G]you and [Em]me in [C]our darkest [D7]hours
To show us [C]how to [G]live to [C]teach us how to [D7]give
And [C]guide us with a [D7]light of [G]love

Verse
When life held [D7]troubled times and [Em]had me down on my [C]knees
[G]There's always been [Em]someone to come [C]along and comfort [D7]me
A [G]kind word from a [D7]stranger to [Em]lend a helping [C]hand
[G]A phone call from a [Em]friend just to say [C]I under[D7]stand
[C]Ain't it kind of [Bm]funny at the [C]dark end of the [D7]road
Some[C]one lights the [G]way with just a [C]single ray of [D7]hope
 
Chorus
Oh [G]I be[Em]lieve there are [C]angels [D7]among us
[G]Sent down to [Em]us from [C]somewhere up [D7]above
They come to [G]you and [Em]me in [C]our darkest [D7]hours
To show us [C]how to [G]live to [C]teach us how to [D7]give
And [C]guide us with a [D7]light of [G]love

Bridge
[C]They wear so [Bm]many faces [C]show up in the [Bm]strangest places
[C]Grace us with their [Bm]mercies in [Am]our time of [D7]need
 
Chorus
Oh [G]I be[Em]lieve there are [C]angels [D7]among us
[G]Sent down to [Em]us from [C]somewhere up [D7]above
They come to [G]you and [Em]me in [C]our darkest [D7]hours
To show us [C]how to [G]live to [C]teach us how to [D7]give
And [C]guide us with a [D7]light of [G]love

Out
To [C]guide us with a [D7]light of [G]love
