A Reason To Fight
Disturbed

Verse 1
[Am]The image [G]in your [C]eyes
Reflecting the [F]pain that has ta[Em]ken you
[Am]I hear it [G]in your vo[C]ice, so ridden with sha[F]me
From what's [Em]hailing you

Pre-Chorus
[F]I won't give [G]up so don't give [Am]in
You've fallen down but [G]you can rise [F]again
So don't give up

Chorus
When the demon that's in[Am]side you is [G]ready to be[D]gin
And it feels like it's a [Am]battle that [G]you will never [D]win
When you're aching for the [Am]fire and [G]begging for your [D]sin
When there's nothing left [F]inside, there's still a [Em]reason to fight

Verse 2
[Am]Lost in your [G]world of [C]lies
I fi[F]nd it so hard to be[Em]lieve in you
[Am]Can it be [G]real this [C]time?
Or just a part of this [F]game that we're play[Em]ing through

Pre-Chorus
[F]I won't give [G]up so don't give [Am]in
You've fallen down but [G]you can rise [F]again
I Won't give up

Chorus
When the demon that's in[Am]side you is [G]ready to be[D]gin
And it feels like it's a [Am]battle that [G]you will never [D]win
When you're aching for the [Am]fire and [G]begging for your [D]sin
When there's nothing left [F]inside, there's still a [Em]reason to fight

Bridge
[F]Don't let it [G]take your [Am]soul
[F]Look at me ta[G]ke con[Am]trol
[F]When knowing to [G]fight this [Am]war
[G]This is nothing [F]worth dying [Em]for

Pre-Chorus
[Am]Are you re[G]ady to be[D]gin?
This is a ba[Am]ttle that [G]we are gonna [D]win

Chorus
When you're aching for the [Am]fire and [G]begging for your [D]sin
When there's nothing left [F]inside, there's still a [Em]reason...
When the demon that's in[Am]side you is [G]ready to be[D]gin
And it feels like it's a [Am]battle that [G]you will never [D]win

Out
When you're aching for the [Am]fire and [G]begging for your [D]sin
When there's nothing left [F]inside, there's still a [Em]reason to fight
[F]I'll be your rea[Em]son to fight
[F]Give you a rea[Em]son to fight
