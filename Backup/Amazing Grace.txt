Amazing Grace
John Newton (1779)
 
 A[E]mazing Grace, how [A]sweet the [E]sound,
 That saved a wretch like [B7]me.
 I [E]once was lost but [A]now am [E]found,
 Was blind, but [B7]now I [E]see.
 
 [E]T'was Grace that taught my [A]heart to [E]fear.
 And Grace, my fears re[B7]lieved.
 How [E]precious did that [A]Grace ap[E]pear
 The hour I [B7]first be[E]lieved.
 
 [E]Through many dangers, [A]toils and [E]snares
 I have already [B7]come;
 'Tis [E]Grace that brought me [A]safe thus [E]far
 and Grace will [B7]lead me [E]home.
 
 The [E]Lord has promised [A]good to [E]me.
 His word my hope se[B7]cures.
 He [E]will my shield and [A]portion [E]be,
 As long as [B7]life en[E]dures.
 
 [E]Yea, when this flesh and [A]heart shall [E]fail,
 And mortal life shall [B7]cease,
 I [E]shall possess with[A]in the [E]veil,
 A life of [B7]joy and [E]peace.
 
 [E]When we've been here ten [A]thousand [E]years
 Bright shining as the [B7]sun.
 [E]We've no less days to [A]sing God's [E]praise
 Than when we've [B7]first be[E]gun.
