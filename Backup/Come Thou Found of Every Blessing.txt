Come Thou Found of Every Blessing

[C]Come Thou Fount of every [G]blessing
Tune my [F]heart to [G]sing Thy [C]grace
Streams of [C]mercy never [G]ceasing
Call for [F]songs of [G]loudest [C]praise
Teach me [Am]some melodious [F]sonnet
Sung by [C]flaming tongues [F]above
Praise the [C]mount I'm fixed [G]upon it
Mount of fThy redee[G]ming [C]love

Here I [C]raise my [G]Ebenezer
Here by [F]Thy great [G]help I've [C]come
And I [C]hope by Thy good [G]pleasure
Safely [F]to arr[G]ive at [C]home
Jesus [Am]sought me when a [F]stranger
Wandering [C]from the fold of [G]God
He to [C]rescue me from [G]danger
Inter[F]posed His [G]precious [C]blood

O to [C]grace how great a de[G]btor
Daily [F]I'm const[G]rained to [C]be
Let Thy [C]goodness like a [G]fetter
Bind my [F]wandering [G]heart to [C]Thee
Prone to [Am]wander Lord I [F]feel it
Prone to [C]leave the God I [F]love
Here's my [C]heart O take and [G]seal it
Seal it [F]for Thy [G]courts [C]above
