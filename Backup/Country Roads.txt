[Am7]I heard he sang [D7]a good song
[G]I heard he [C]had a style

[Em]And listen [Em]for a while
[Am7]And there he [D7]was this young boy
[G]A stranger [B7]to my eyes...

[Am7]I felt all flushed [D]with fever
[G]Embarrassed [C]by the crowd
[Am7]I felt he [D]found my letters

[Am7]I prayed that [D7]he would finish
[G]But he just [B7]kept right on....
