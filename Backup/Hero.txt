Would you [G]dance,
If I asked you to [Em]dance?

Would you [C]save my [D]soul to[G]night?

Verse 2
Would you [G]tremble
If I touched your [Em]lips?
Would you [C]laugh,
Oh please tell me [D]this.
Now would you [G]die,
For the one you [Em]love.
Hold me [C]in your [D]arms to[G]night.

Chorus
[G]I can [D]be your hero, [C]baby.
[G]I can [D]kiss away the [C]pain.
[G]I will [D]stand by you for[C]ever.
[G]You can [D]take my [C]breath away.

Verse 3
Would you [G]swear,
That you'll always be [Em]mine?
Would you [C]lie,
Would you run [D]back?
Am I in too [Em]deep?
Have I lost my [C]mind?
I don't [C]care, you're [D]here to[G]night.
