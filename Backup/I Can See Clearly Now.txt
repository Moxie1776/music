I Can See Clearly Now
Johnny Nash

[D]I can see c[G]learly now the r[D]ain is gone
[D]I can see a[G]ll obstacles [A]in my way
[D]Gone all the d[G]ark clouds that m[D]ade me blind

It's gonna be a b[C]right, (bright) br[G]ight, (bright) sun shiny d[D]ay
It's gonna be a b[C]right, (bright) br[G]ight, (bright) sun shiny d[D]ay

[D]I think I can[G] make it now the[D] pain is gone
[D]All of the [G]bad feelings have [A]disapeared
[D]Here is the rainbow[G] I've been [D]praying for

It's gonna be a b[C]right, (bright) br[G]ight, (bright) sun shiny d[D]ay
It's gonna be a b[C]right, (bright) br[G]ight, (bright) sun shiny d[D]ay

[F]Look all around, there's nothing but b[C]lue skies
[F]Look straight ahead, there's nothing but b[A]lue skies
