I Know It's Too Late
Rebekah White

Verse
[A]Your face it haunts me in the d[D]ark
I can't [E]see just what you [F#m]are
[A]So torn apart
F[#m]I'm not quite sure why I'm [Bm]here
If you're everything [F#m]I feared
I let down my [E]guard
I'm [D]so possessed with this[D] obsession
The[A]re's no turning back

Chorus
[G#m]But you follow me ho[F#m]me
You're inside my mi[Bm]nd
Got me so confus[D]ed
Don't know wrong from ri[E]ght
The thrill of this pa[F#m]in
Still drives me ins[Dm]ane
But I[D] can't esc[A]ape
I kn[Em]ow it's too la[F#m]te...

Verse
[F#m]Don't know what side of this I'm [Bm]on
These lines I'm stumbling up[F#m]on
I ca[D]n't see clear
[F#m]Oh my God what have I do[Bm]ne?
Who have I be[F#m]come?
I've disappe[E]ared
[F#m]Lies are my al[D]ibis
There's n[A]o turning bac[G#m]k

Chorus
[G#m]But you follow me ho[F#m]me
You're inside my mi[Bm]nd
Got me so confus[D]ed
Don't know wrong from ri[E]ght
The thrill of this pa[F#m]in
Still drives me ins[Dm]ane
But I[D] can't esc[A]ape
I kn[Em]ow it's too la[C#m]te...

Bridge
So I'll sit here and wa[D]it
Not alarmed by my f[A]ate
That I must em[E]brace
Wish I could be like y[Cm]ou
'Cause I cannot und[D]o
I did it all for y[A]ou...

Bridge 2
[C#m]And you follow me ho[C#]me
You're inside my mind
Got me so confused
Don't know wrong from right
The thr[F#]ill of this p[F#M]ain
Still drives me ins[Bm]ane
But [D]I can't esc[E]ape
I know it's too l[F#m]ate

Out
I know it's too l[D]ate
Too late
Too l[E]ate
I know it's too l[F#m]ate
[Bm]And I can't esca[D]pe
[E]I know it's too late...
