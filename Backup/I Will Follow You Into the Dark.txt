In Catholic school, as vicious as [Dm] Roman rule
I got my [Bb] knuckles bruised

Fear is the [Bb] heart of love."
So [F] I never went [C] back

You and me we've seen every [Dm] thing to see
From Bangkok to [Bb] Calgary
And the [F] soles of our [C] shoes [CaddG]
Are [F] all worn down, the time for [Dm] sleep is now
It's nothing to [Bb] cry about
'Cause we'll [F] hold each other [C] soon [CaddG]
In the [Dm] blackest of [Bb] rooms
