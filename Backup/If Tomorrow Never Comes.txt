If Tomorrow Never Comes
Garth Brooks

Verse 
Sometimes late at[Am] night
[D]I lie awake and watch her [C]sle[G]eping[Am7][G]
She's [D]lost in peaceful [Am]dreams
[D] [C] [G][AM7]
[G]So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my[Am] mind
[D]If I never wake up in the [C]mor[G]ning[Am7][G]
[D]Would she ever [Am]doubt the [D]way I feel
[C]About her in my [G]heart[Am7][G]

Chorus
If tomorrow never [C]comes
Will she know how much I [G]loved her
Did I try in every [D]way to [Am]show her every [D]day
That [C]she's my only [G]one
And if my [Am]time on e[Am/B]arth were th[C]rough
And she must face this [D]world with[Em]out me
Is the love I gave her in the [Am]past
Gonna be enough to [D]last
If tomorrow never [G]comes[Am7][G]

Verse
'Cause I've lost love ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

Out
[G]So tell that someone that you [Am7]love
Just what you`re thinking [D]of
If tomorrow never [C]comes[G/B][Am7][G]
