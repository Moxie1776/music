Jesus, Take the Wheel
Carrie Underwood

She was d[C]riving last Friday o[G/B]n her way to Cincinnati
On a [Am7]snow white Christmas [G/B]Eve
[C]Going home to see her [G/B]Mama and her Daddy
With the [Am7]baby in the backs[G/B]eat
Fifty [C]miles to go and she was [G/B]running low on [Am7]faith and gaso[G/B]line
It'd been a l[F]ong hard year

She had a l[C]ot on her mind and she [G/B]didn't pay attention
She was [Am7]going way too [G/B]fast
[C]Before she k[G/B]new it she was spinning
On a t[Am7]hin black sheet of g[G/B]lass
She saw b[C]oth their lives flash b[G/B]efore her eyes
[Am7]She didn't even have [G/B]time to cry
She was s[F]o scared, she threw her h[C]ands up in the air

Chorus:
Jesus take the w[G]heel
Take it from my h[D]ands
Cause I can't do this [Am]on [G/B]my o[C]wn
I'm letting [G]go
So give me one more ch[D]ance
Save me from this r[Am]oad [G/B]I'm [C]on
Jesus take the wh[C]eel [G/B][Am7][G/B][C][G/B][F]

It was st[C]ill getting colder when she [G/B]made it to the shoulder
And the [Am7]car came to a [G/B]stop
She cr[C]ied when she saw that [G/B]baby in the backseat
[Am7]Sleeping like a r[G/B]ock
And for the f[C]irst time in a l[G/B]ong time
She b[Am7]owed her head to p[G/B]ray
She said I'm s[F]orry for the way I[C]'ve been living my life
I k[F]now I've got to change, so from n[C]ow on tonight

Chorus:
Jesus take the w[G]heel
Take it from my h[D]ands
Cause I can't do this [Am]on [G/B]my o[C]wn
I'm letting [G]go
So give me one more ch[D]ance
Save me from this r[Am]oad [G/B]I'm [C]on
Jesus take the w[G]heel.[D]...[Am]....[C].

Ohh I'm letting [G]go
So give me one more ch[D]ance
Save me from this r[Am]oad [G/B]I'm [C]on
From this r[Am]oad [G/B]I'm [C]on
Jesus take the wh[C]eel [G/B] [Am7]
[G/B]Oh, take it, t[C]ake it from[G/B] me
[Am7]Oh..[G/B].., w[C]hoa [G/B] [Am7] oh..[G/B].....[C]...[G/B]... [F]
