intro:
[Dm] [G] [Am] [F] [Dm] [G] [Am] [G]

Verse 1
O[G]h, li[Am]fe it's bigger
[Em]it's bigger that you
and [Am]you are not me
The lengths that I will [Em]go to
the distance in your e[Am]yes
[Em]Oh no I've said too [Dm]much
I set it u[G]p

Chorus
That's me in the c[Am]orner
that's me in the s[Em]potlight
losing my r[Am]eligion
Trying to k[Em]eep up with you
and I [Am]don't know if I can do i[Em]t
Oh no I've said too [Dm]much
I haven't said en[G]ough

Bridge
I thought that I heard you [F]laughing
I thought that I heard you [Am]sing
I [F]think I thought I [Dm]saw you t[Am]ry [G]

Verse 2
Every [Am]whisper of every waking [Em]hour
I'm choosing my con[Am]fessions
Trying to [Em]keep an eye on you
like a [Am]hurt lost and blinded fool
[Em]Oh no I've said too [Dm]much
I set it u[G]p

Verse 3
Consider [Am]this, consider this
the [Em]hint of the century
Consider th[Am]is, the slip that
[Em]brought me to my knees, failed
[Am]what if all these fantasies
come [Em]Flailing around
Now I've [Dm]said too [G]much

Bridge
I thought that I heard you [F]laughing
I thought that I heard you [Am]sing
I [F]think I thought I [Dm]saw you t[Am]ry [G]

Bridge 2
But [Am]that was just a dream
[C]That was just a [G]dream

Chorus
That's me in the c[Am]orner
that's me in the s[Em]potlight
losing my r[Am]eligion
Trying to k[Em]eep up with you
and I [Am]don't know if I can do i[Em]t
Oh no I've said too [Dm]much
I haven't said en[G]ough

Bridge
I thought that I heard you [F]laughing
