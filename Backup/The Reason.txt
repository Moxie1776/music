The Reason
Hoobastank

Verse 1
[C]I'm not a perfect[Am] person
As many things I wish I didn't [C]do
But I continue [Am]learning
I never meant to do those things to [F]you
And so I have to say before I [G]go
That I just want you to kn[C]ow

Chorus
I've found a reason for [Am]me
To change who I used to [F]be
A reason to start over n[G]ew
and the reason is y[C]ou

Verse 2
[C]I'm sorry that I hurt[Am ]you
It's something I must live with every[C]day
And all the pain I put you th[Am]rough
I wish that I could take it all aw[F]ay
And be the one who catches all your te[G]ars
That's why I need you to he[C]ar

Chorus
I've found a reason for [Am]me
To change who I used to [F]be
A reason to start over n[G]ew

Bridge                
and the reason is y[Bb]ou 
and the reason is y[C]ou 
and the reason is y[Bb]ou 
and the reason is y[C]ou 

Verse 3
[C]I'm not a perfect[Am] person
I never meant to do those things to [F]you
And so I have to say before I [G]go
That I just want you to kn[C]ow

End Chorus
I've found a reason for [Am]me
To change who I used to [F]be
A reason to start over n[G]ew
and the reason is y[C]ou

Out
I've found a reason to sh[Am]ow
A side of me you didn't kn[F]ow                            
A reason for all that I [G]do
and the reason is y[C]ou
