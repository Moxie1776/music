The Sound of Silence
Simon & Garfunkel

Intro: Dm 
Hello darkness, my old f[C]riend
I've come to talk with you ag[Dm]ain, 
Because a v[F]ision softly c[Bb]reepi[F]ng
left its seeds while I was s[Bb]leepi[F]ng, 
And the [Bb]vision that was planted in my br[F]ain
still rema[Dm]ins
[F]Within the s[C]ound of sil[Dm]ence

Verse
[Dm]In restless dreams I walked a[C]lone
narrow streets of cobblest[Dm]one, 
'Neath the halo [F]of a st[Bb]reet la[F]mp
I turned my collar to the c[Bb]old and da[F]mp, 
When my e[Bb]yes were stabbed
by the flash of a neon li[F]ght
that split the n[Dm]ight[F], 
And touched the s[C]ound of [Dm]silence

Verse
[Dm]And in the naked light I s[C]aw
ten thousand people, maybe m[Dm]ore, 
People talking w[F]ithout sp[Bb]eaki[F]ng
people hearing without l[Bb]isteni[F]ng, 
People w[Bb]riting songs that voices never sh[F]are
and no one dare,[Dm]
[F]Disturb the s[C]ound of [Dm]silence

Verse
[Dm]"Fools!" said I, "You do not kn[C]ow
silence like a cancer gro[Dm]ws 
"Hear my words that [F]I might t[Bb]each y[F]ou
take my arms that I might r[Bb]each y[F]ou." 
But my w[Bb]ords like silent raindrops f[F]el[Dm]l
and ech[F]oed in the we[C]lls of [Dm]silence

Verse 
And the people bowed and pra[C]yed
to the neon god they m[Dm]ade, 
And the sign flashed o[F]ut its w[Bb]arni[F]ng
in the words that it was [Bb]formi[F]ng, 
And the signs said
The w[Bb]ords of the prophets are written On the subway wa[F]lls
and tenement halls[Dm] 
And wh[F]isper'd in the sou[C]nds of s[Dm]ilence
