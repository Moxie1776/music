INTRO: Em F#m G A

Verse
[D]Just the other night and a [G]hometown football game
My [D]wife and I ran [Bm]into [Em]my old high school [A]flame
And [G]as I intro[F#m]duced them the [Bm]past came back to [G]me
And I [Em]couldn't help but [F#m]think of the [G]way things used to [A]be

Verse
[D]She was the one that I'd [G]wanted for all times
And [D]each night I'd spend [Bm]prayin' that [Em]God would make her [A]mine
And [G]if he'd only [F#m]grant me this [Bm]wish I wished back [G]then
I'd [Em]never ask for [F#m]anything [A]again

CHORUS:
Sometimes I thank [D]God for [G]unanswered pra[A]yers
Reme[D]mber when you're tal[Bm]kin' to the [Em]man upsta[A]irs
That just be[D]cause he doesn't [F#m]answer doesn't [G]mean he don't [Bm]care
Some of [D]God's greatest [A]gifts[G] are unanswered pra[D]yers

Verse
[D]She wasn't quite the angel that I reme[G]mbered in my dreams
And I could [D]tell that time had [Bm]changed me
In [Em]her eyes too it [A]seemed
We tried to [G]talk about the [F#m]old days
There wasn't [Bm]much we could re[G]call
I guess the [Em]Lord knows what he's [F#m]doin' after [A]all

Bridge
And [G]as she walked away I [F#m]looked at my [Bm]wife
And then and [Em]there I thanked the [F#m]good Lord
For the [G]gifts in my [A]life

CHORUS:
Sometimes I thank [D]God for [G]unanswered pra[A]yers
Reme[D]mber when you're tal[Bm]kin' to the [Em]man upsta[A]irs
That just be[D]cause he may not [F#m]answer doesn't [G]mean he don't [Bm]care
