Verse I
The d[D]ays will come when [Em]you don't have the stre[C]ngth
When [Em]all you hear is you're [D]not worth any[C]thing
Wo[D]ndering if you [Em]ever could be lo[C]ved
And if they [Em]truly saw your [D]heart they'd see too [C]much

Chorus
You're beauti[G]ful
You're beauti[C]ful
You are [Em]made so much [D]more than all of [C]this
You're beauti[G]ful
You're beauti[C]ful
You are [Em]treasured, You are [D]sacred, You are [C]His
You're beauti[G]ful

Verse II
And pra[D]ying that you [Em]have the heart to f[C]ind
Cause you are [Em]more than what is [D]hurting you ton[C]ight
For [D]all the lies you've [Em]held inside so [C]long
And they are [Em]nothing in the [D]shadow of the cr[C]oss

Chorus
You're beauti[G]ful
You're beauti[C]ful

[D]Before you ever took a [C]breath
Long before the world b[D]egan
Of all the wonders He p[C]ossessed
There was one more prec[D]ious
Of all the earth and skies a[C]bove
You're the one He madly lov[D]es
Enough to d[C]ie  [G]

Out
You're beauti[C]ful
You're beauti[Em]ful
In His [C]eyes

End                             
You are [Em]treasured you are [D]sacred you are [C]His
