[F]I know you’ll always jump in 
[C]Cause we don’t know how to qui[E]t 
1--*
Pre-Chorus
Let’s start a ri[Am]ot tonight 
A pack of li[F]ons tonight 
In this world [C]he who stops 
Won’t get anyth[E]ing he wants 
Play like the [Am]top one percent 
‘Til nothing is le[F]ft to spend 
Take it all[C], ours to take 
Celebrate[E] because 

Chorus
We are the [Am]champions 
Setting it off[F] again 
Oh, we’re on f[C]ire

Oh, we’re on f[C]ire
We’re on f[E]ire 

Refrain

Throw your hands up 
W[F]elcome to the other land of
Dr[C]eamers, brothers, sisters, others 
Y[E]eah, we’re on fire like that

[F]The kind of club that we’re in 
[C]The kind of love that we gi[E]ve                                
[Am]Oh, ever since the dawn of mankind
