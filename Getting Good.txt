Getting Good
Lauren Alaina

Verse
[G]Once I fall in love then I'll be hap[C]py
But th[G]en you fall in love and there's still a h[D]ole
O[G]nce I get some money it'll all be [C]easy
But th[E]en you get that money, you still feel br[D]oke

Chorus
Once I g[C]et a little older, I won't w[G]orry
Then you get [Em]older and it don't feel like it sho[D]uld
I'm thinking [G]once I learn to gro[D]w right where I'm pla[C]nted
Maybe that's when l[D]ife starts getting g[G]ood

Verse
O[G]nce I get a car that don't stall in the m[C]orning
I can m[G]ake it anywhere I want, just w[D]ait
But I can s[G]ee it right now sitting in my dr[C]iveway
Afraid [G]if I take it out, I'll chip the pa[D]int

Chorus
Once I g[C]et a house that I can hang my h[G]at on
I bet I'll w[Em]ant to build a bigger one if I co[D]uld, yeah
I'm thinking, o[G]nce I learn to gr[D]ow right where I'm pl[C]anted
Maybe that's when l[D]ife starts getting g[G]ood
Oh, getting g[Em]ooooo[C]ooooo[G]od
Getting g[Em]ooooo[C]ooooo[D]od
Life starts getting g[Em]ooooo[C]ooooo[G]od
I'm thinking maybe that's when l[D]ife starts getting go[G]od

Bridge
[Em] - [C] - [G]
That's when life starts getting go[Em]od[C], [D]oh
[Em] - [C] - [G] - [D] - [G]

Verse
I[G]'m afraid of both my parents d[C]ying
I c[G]all my dad, he answers right aw[D]ay
And I d[Em]idn't hear a word 'cause I was th[C]inking
About what h[G]asn't happened yet but will someda[D]y

Chorus
And w[C]e hang up the phone before I kn[G]ow it
I'm crying [Em]over the conversation my fear t[D]ook
I'm thinking o[G]nce I learn to s[D]oak up every m[C]oment
I'll realize my l[D]ife's already go[G]od
Already g[Em]ooooo[C]ooooo[G]od
Already g[Em]ooooo[C]ooooo[D]od
Life's already g[Em]ooooo[C]ooooo[G]od
I'll realize my l[D]ife's already g[Em]ood
Th[C]ank God that my l[D]ife's already go[G]od
