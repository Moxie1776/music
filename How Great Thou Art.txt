Verse 1
O Lord my [G]God, When I in [C]awesome wonder,
consider [G]all the [D]Worlds Thy hand hath [G]made.
I see the stars, I hear the [C]rolling thunder
Thy pow'r through[G]out the [D]universe [G]displayed

Chorus
Then sings my [G]soul, my [C]Savior God, to [G]Thee
How great Thou [Am]art! How great Thou [G]art!
Then sings my soul, my [C]Savior God, to [G]Thee
How great Thou [Am]art! [C]How great Thou [G]art!

Verse 2
And when I [G]think that God, His [C]Son not sparing
Sent Him to [G]die, I [D]scarce can take it [G]in
That on the [G]cross, my burden [C]gladly bearing
He bled and [G]died to [D]take away my [G]sin

Chorus
Then sings my [G]soul, my [C]Savior God, to [G]Thee
How great Thou [Am]art! How great Thou [G]art!

Verse 3
When Christ shall [G]come, with shouts of [C]acclamation
And take me [G]home, what [D]joy shall fill my [G]heart
Then I shall [G]bow in humble [C]adoration
And there [G]proclaim, My [D]God, how great Thou [G]art!

Chorus
Then sings my [G]soul, my [C]Savior God, to [G]Thee
How great Thou [Am]art! How great Thou [G]art!
