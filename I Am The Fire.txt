I Am The Fire

Verse 1
[Am]Am I brave enough?
Am I strong enough[C]?
To follow the desir[G]e
That burns from withi[Am]n
To push away my fea[C]r
To stand where I'm afra[Am]id
I am through with this[G]
Cuz I am more than [Em]this
I promise to m[Am]yself
Alone and no one [C]else
My flame is rising [Em]higher

Chorus
I am the [Am]fire       
I am burning [C]brighter
Roaring like a [G]storm                   
And I am the o[D]ne I've been waiting [Am]for
Screaming like a s[C]iren
Alive and burning b[G]righter
I am the f[D]ire

Verse 2
[Am]I've been sacrificed
My Hearts been cauterize[C]d
Hanging on to hop[G]e
Shackled by the gh[Em]ost
Of what I once believe[C]d
That I could never b[G]e
What's right in front of [Em]me?

Alive and burning b[G]righter
