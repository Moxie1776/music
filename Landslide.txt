Landslide
Fleetwood Mac

[C]I took my lo[G]ve and I took it do[Am]wn[G]
[C]I climbed a [G]mountain and I tu[Am]rned around[G]
And I [C]saw my reflec[G]tion in the sno[Am]w covered hills[G]
Until the l[C]andslide br[G]ought me dow[Am]n

Oh m[C]irror in the [G]sky
What is [Am]love[G]
Can the [C]child within my[G] heart
[Am]Rise Above[G]
Can I [C]sail through the [G]changing
[Am]Ocean Tides[G]
Can I h[C]andle all the [G]season of[Am] my life[G]

m[C]mm... mmm...[G]
I dont [Am]know
mmm.... mm[G]m...

Well [C]Ive been afra[G]id of changing[Am]
[G]Cause I bu[Am]ilt my life arou[G]nd you
B[C]ut time makes you[G] bolder
[Am]Children get o[G]lder
I[C] am getting old[G]er too[Am][G]

Well [C]Ive been afra[G]id of changing[Am]
[G]Cause I bu[Am]ilt my life arou[G]nd you
B[C]ut time makes you[G] bolder
[Am]Children get o[G]lder
I[C] am getting old[G]er too[Am][G]

Sooo...
[C]Take this l[G]ove and take it[Am] down[G]
If[C] you climb a m[G]ountain and you[Am] turn around [G]
And if yo[C]u see my re[G]flection in the
[Am]Snow covered [G]hills then a[C] landslide w[Am]ill bring you [G]down

And if you s[C]ee my relfec[G]tion in the
[Am]Snow covered hi[G]lls well maybe[C]...

A[G] landslide wil[Am]l bring you d[G]own
[C]Well well a l[G]andslide brin[Am]g ya down[G]
