Stand by Me

Verse
W[C]hen the night has come
[Am]And the land is dark
And the mo[F]on is the on[G]ly light we'll see[C]
[C]No I won't be afraid, no I wo[Am]n't be afraid
Just as lo[F]ng as you st[G]and, stand by m[C]e

Chorus
[C]And darlin', darlin', sta[C]nd by me, oh now now st[Am]and by me
St[F]and by me, st[G]and by me[C]

Verse
[C]If the sky that we look upon
[Am]Should tumble and fall
And the mount[F]ains should crum[G]ble to the sea
I[C] won't cry, I won't cry, no I wo[Am]n't shed a tear
Just as lo[F]ng as you sta[G]nd, stand by me

Chorus
A[C]nd darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh sta[Am]nd by me
Sta[F]nd by me, sta[G]nd by me, stand by me[C]e, yeah

Out
W[C]henever you're in trouble won't you st[C]and by me, oh now now sta[Am]nd by me
Oh st[F]and by me, st[G]and by me, stand by me[C]
D[C]arlin', darlin', stand by me-e, sta[Am]nd by me
Oh sta[F]nd by me, st[G]and by me, stand by me[C]
