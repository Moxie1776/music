The Old Rugged Cross
George Bennard

Verse
On a [G]hill far away stood an [C]old rugged [C]cross,
The [D]emblem of s[D]uffering and s[G]ha[G]me,
And I l[G]ove that old c[G]ross where the dea[C]rest and b[C]est
For a [D]world of lost s[D]inners was s[G]lai[G]n.

Chorus
So I'll [D]cherish the o[D]ld rugged c[G]ro[G]ss,
Till my [C]trophies at [C]last I lay [G]dow[G]n,
I will cl[G]ing to the o[G]ld rugged [C]cro[C]ss,
And ex[D]change it some d[D]ay for a [G]crown[G].

Verse
Oh, that [G]old rugged [G]Cross so des[C]pised by the w[C]orld
Has a w[D]ondrous [D]attraction for [G]me[G]
For the [G]dear Lamb of [G]God, left his G[C]lory ab[C]ove
To be[D]ar it to d[D]ark Cal[G]var[G]y

Chorus
So I'll [D]cherish the o[D]ld rugged c[G]ro[G]ss,
Till my [C]trophies at [C]last I lay [G]dow[G]n,
I will cl[G]ing to the o[G]ld rugged [C]cro[C]ss,
And ex[D]change it some d[D]ay for a [G]crown[G].

Verse
In the o[G]ld rugged C[G]ross, stain'd with b[C]lood so di[C]vine
A wond[D]rous bea[D]uty I s[G]ee[G]
For 'twas [G]on that old c[G]ross Jesus su[C]ffered and d[C]ied
To pa[D]rdon and san[D]ctify [G]me[G]

Chorus
So I'll [D]cherish the o[D]ld rugged c[G]ro[G]ss,
Till my [C]trophies at [C]last I lay [G]dow[G]n,
I will cl[G]ing to the o[G]ld rugged [C]cro[C]ss,
And ex[D]change it some d[D]ay for a [G]crown[G].

Verse
To the [G]old rugged c[G]ross I will e[C]ver be t[C]rue,
It's [D]shame and repr[D]oach gladly [G]bea[G]r,
Then he'll c[G]all me some d[G]ay to my h[C]ome far a[C]way,
Where his [D]glory fo[G]rever I'll s[G]har[G]e.

Chorus
And I'll [D]cherish the o[D]ld rugged c[G]ros[G]s
Till my [C]trophies at la[C]st I lay d[G]own[G];
I will c[G]ling to the o[G]ld rugged c[C]ros[C]s
And e[G]xchange it some [D]day for a c[G]row[G]n
