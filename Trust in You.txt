Trust in You
Lauren Daigle

Verse
[G]Letting go of every single dream, [Em]I lay each one down at your feet,
[Am]Every moment of my wandering, [C]Never changes what you see,
[G]I've tried to win this war I confess, [Em]My hands are weary I need your rest,
[Am]Mighty warrior, king of the fight, [C]No matter what I face you're by my side, 

Chorus
[G]When you don't move the mountains [D]I'm needing you to move,
[Em]When you don't part the waters I [C]wish I could walk through,
[G]When you don't give the answers [D]as I cry out to you,
[Em]I will trust, I will [C]trust, I will trust in [G]you[D]

Verse
[G]Truth is you know what tomorrow brings, [Em]There's not a day ahead you have not seen,
[Am]So in all things be my life and breath, [C]I want what you want lord and nothing less,

Chorus
[G]When you don't move the mountains [D]I'm needing you to move,
[Em]When you don't part the waters I [C]wish I could walk through,
[G]When you don't give the answers [D]as I cry out to you,
[Em]I will trust, I will [C]trust, I will trust in [G]you[D]

Bridge
[C]You are my strength and comfort, [D]You are my steady hand,
[Em]You are my firm foundation, The rock on which I stand,
[C]Your ways are always higher, [D]Your plans are always good,
[Em]There's not a place where I'll go [D]you've not already stood,

Chorus
[G]When you don't move the mountains [D]I'm needing you to move,
[Em]When you don't part the waters I [C]wish I could walk through,
[G]When you don't give the answers [D]as I cry out to you,
[Em]I will trust, I will [C]trust, I will trust in [G]you[D][G]
