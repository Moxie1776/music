Without You
David Guetta

[D]I can't win, I can't reign
[G]I will never win this game with[Bm]out you
With[G]out you
[D]I am lost, I am vain
[G]I will never be the same
[Bm]Without you, with[G]out you

[D]I won't run, I won't fly
[G]I will never make it by with[Bm]out you
With[G]out you
[D]I can't rest, I can't fight
[G]All I need is you and I
[Bm]Without you, with[G]out you

[D]Can't erase, so I'll take blame
[G]But I can't accept that we're estranged
[Bm]Without you, with[G]out you
[D]I can't quit now, This can't be right
[G]I can't take one more sleepless night
[Bm]Without you, with[G]out you

[D]I won't soar, I won't climb
[G]If you're not here i'm, paralyzed
[Bm]Without you, with[G]out you
[D]I can't look, I'm so blind
[G]I lost my heart, I lost my mind
[Bm]Without you, with[G]out you

[D]I am lost, I am vain
[G]I will never be the same
[Bm]Without you, with[G]out you
[D]Without you
