You Say
Lauren Daigle

Verse 1
[G]I keep fighting voices in my [Bm]mind that say I'm not [Em]enough[C]
[G]Every single lie that tells me [Bm]I will never measure [Em]up[C]
[G]I more than just the sum of [Bm]every high and every [Em]low?[C]
[G]Remind me once again just who I [Bm]am, because I need to [Em]know[C]

Chorus
You say I am [G]loved when I can't feel a [Bm]thing
You say I am [Em]strong when I think I am [C]weak
You say I am [G]held when I am falling [Bm]short
When I don't [Em]belong, oh You say that I am [C]Yours
And I [G]believe, oh I [Bm]believe
What You [Em]say of me
I [C]believe

Verse 2
[G]The only thing that matters now is [Bm]everything You think of [Em]me[C]
[G]In You I find my worth, in You I [Bm]find my iden[Em]tity, o-ooh[C]

Chorus
You say I am [G]loved when I can't feel a [Bm]thing
You say I am [Em]strong when I think I am [C]weak
You say I am [G]held when I am falling [Bm]short
When I don't [Em]belong, oh You say that I am [C]Yours
And I [G]believe, oh I [Bm]believe
What You [Em]say of me
I [C]believe

Verse 3
[G]Taking all I have and now I'm [Bm]laying it at Your [Em]feet[C]
[G]You have every failure God, and [Bm]You'll have every [Em]victory, o-ooh[C]

Chorus
You say I am [G]loved when I can't feel a [Bm]thing
You say I am [Em]strong when I think I am [C]weak
You say I am [G]held when I am falling [Bm]short
When I don't [Em]belong, oh You say that I am [C]Yours
And I [G]believe, oh I [Bm]believe
What You [Em]say of me
I [C]believe

Outro
Oh I be[G]lieve, yes I be[Bm]lieve
What You [Em]say of me
Oh I be[C]lieve
